# Simple Todo Application Demo:
This is an andorid application for maintaing a to-do list. The application can be used for adding items and its priority to the list, displaying items in a list and editing or deleting an item from the list. I have now updated the functionality to add items to an SQLiteDatabase using SQLiteOpenHelper class. I have used a custom adapter for improving the style of the list items. 

Completed User Stories:
* Required: User can view the list of todos.

* Used DialogFragment instead of activity for adding/editing items.
* Added the option of adding completion due dates for each item and added to the list.
