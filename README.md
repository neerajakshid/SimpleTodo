# Simple Todo Application Demo:
This is an andorid application for maintaing a to-do list. The applciation can be used for adding items and its priority to the list, displaying items in a list and editing or deleting an item from the list. I have now updated the functionality to add items to an SQLiteDatabase using SQLiteOpenHelper class. I have used a custom adapter for improving the style of the list items.
